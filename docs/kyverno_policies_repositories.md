## Kyverno policies repositories

Kyverno policies repositories are expected to be hosted in GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket repos. When adding your repository to Artifact Hub, the url used **must** follow the following format:

- `https://github.com/user/repo[/path/to/packages]`
- `https://gitlab.com/user/repo[/path/to/packages]`
- `https://bitbucket.org/user/repo[/path/to/packages]`

By default the `master` branch is used, but it's possible to specify a different one from the UI.

*Please NOTE that the repository URL used when adding the repository to Artifact Hub **must NOT** contain the git hosting platform specific parts, like **tree/branch**, just the path to your packages like it would show in the filesystem.*

The *path/to/packages* provided can contain metadata for one or more packages. Each package version **must** be on a separate folder, and it's up to you to decide if you want to publish one or multiple versions of your package.

The structure of a repository with multiple policies packages and versions could look something like this:

```sh
$ tree path/to/packages
path/to/packages
├── artifacthub-repo.yml
├── package1
│   ├── 1.0.0
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   └── artifacthub-pkg.yml
│   └── 2.0.0
│       ├── README.md
│       └── artifacthub-pkg.yml
└── package2
    └── 1.0.0
        ├── README.md
        └── artifacthub-pkg.yml
```

This structure is flexible, and in some cases it can be greatly simplified. Nested directories are also supported. In the case of a single package with a single version available at a time (the publisher doesn't want to make previous ones available, for example), the structure could look like this:

```sh
$ tree path/to/packages
path/to/packages
├── artifacthub-repo.yml
└── package1
    ├── README.md
    └── artifacthub-pkg.yml
```

In the previous case, even the `package1` directory could be omitted. The reason is that both packages names and versions are read from the `artifacthub-pkg.yml` metadata file, so directories names are not used at all.

Each package version **needs** an `artifacthub-pkg.yml` metadata file. Please see the file [spec](https://github.com/artifacthub/hub/blob/master/docs/metadata/artifacthub-pkg.yml) for more details. The [artifacthub-repo.yml](https://github.com/artifacthub/hub/blob/master/docs/metadata/artifacthub-repo.yml) repository metadata file shown above can be used to setup features like [Verified publisher](https://github.com/artifacthub/hub/blob/master/docs/repositories.md#verified-publisher) or [Ownership claim](https://github.com/artifacthub/hub/blob/master/docs/repositories.md#ownership-claim). This file must be located at `/path/to/packages`.

In order to locate the Kyverno policy within a given folder, Artifact Hub assumes the policy is named the same as the folder in which it occurs. For example, a policy YAML file named `require-labels.yaml` is expected to be in a folder named `require-labels`.

Once you have added your repository, you are all set up. As you add new versions of your policies packages or even new packages to your git repository, they'll be automatically indexed and listed in Artifact Hub.
