In Artifact Hub, the `official` status means that the publisher **owns the software deployed** by *all* the packages available in the repository. When this status is granted for a repository, all packages available on it will display a badge on the UI.

**Before applying for this status, please make sure your repository complies with the following requirements:**

- [ ] The repository has already obtained the [Verified Publisher](https://artifacthub.io/docs/topics/repositories/#verified-publisher) status.
- [ ] The repository *only* contains `official` packages. A mix of official and non-official packages is not allowed at the moment, but we are considering to allow the `official` status to be set [at the package level](https://github.com/artifacthub/hub/issues/972) and this might change in the future.
- [ ] The user requesting the status is the publisher of the repository in Artifact Hub, or belongs to the organization publishing it.
- [ ] The packages available in the repository provide some documentation, usually in the form of a `README.md` file.
