# Roadmap

At a high level the roadmap is focused on the following 3 categories:

- Add **support for more Cloud Native artifacts** from CNCF projects
- **Improve documentation** to consolidate useful information spread across issues, discussions and Slack conversations
- Continue to **improve users' experience** to make it easier to find artifacts and explore their content

Changes in these categories happen in an agile manner with constant development but without having a long backlog.
