[Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io) is a web-based application that enables finding, installing, and publishing packages and configurations for CNCF projects.

Discovering artifacts to use with CNCF projects can be difficult. If every CNCF project that needs to share artifacts creates its own Hub this creates a fair amount of repeat work for each project and a fractured experience for those trying to find the artifacts to consume. The Artifact Hub attempts to solve that by providing a single experience for consumers that any CNCF project can leverage.

At the moment, the following artifacts kinds are supported *(with plans to support more projects to follow)*:

- [Containers images](https://opencontainers.org)
- [CoreDNS plugins](https://coredns.io/)
- [Falco configurations](https://falco.org/)
- [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/)
- [Helm plugins](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/plugins/)
- [KEDA scalers](https://keda.sh/)
- [Keptn integrations](https://keptn.sh)
- [Kubectl plugins (Krew)](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/)
- [Kubewarden policies](https://www.kubewarden.io)
- [OLM operators](https://github.com/operator-framework)
- [Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)
- [Tekton tasks and pipelines](https://tekton.dev/)
- [Tinkerbell actions](https://tinkerbell.org/)

You can use Artifact Hub to:

- [Discover](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search), [install](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/artifact-hub/artifact-hub?modal=install) and [publish](https://artifacthub.io/docs/topics/repositories/) packages and configurations
- Explore content like Helm charts [schemas](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/artifact-hub/artifact-hub?modal=values-schema) and [templates](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/artifact-hub/artifact-hub/0.20.0?modal=template&template=db_migrator_install_job.yaml) in an interactive way
- Subscribe to packages' new releases and security alerts notifications, via email or webhooks
- Visualize packages' [security reports](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/artifact-hub/artifact-hub/0.19.0?modal=security-report)
- Inspect packages' [changelog](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/artifact-hub/artifact-hub?modal=changelog)

## Getting started

[Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io) allows publishers to list their content in an automated way. Please check out the [repositories guide](https://artifacthub.io/docs/topics/repositories/) for more details about how to add your repositories.

If you want to run your own Artifact Hub instance in your Kubernetes cluster, the easiest way is by deploying the Helm chart provided. For more details, please see the [Helm chart documentation in Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/artifact-hub/artifact-hub).
